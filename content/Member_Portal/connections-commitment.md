# **Welcome to the Wilderness Pathfinder Connections Community!**

Whether you're a woman veteran aspiring to be a wilderness guide, a seasoned mentor offering your expertise, or a passionate supporter of our mission, we're thrilled to have you join our community.

By participating in our programs, forums, and activities, you agree to uphold the following principles to ensure a safe, supportive, and enriching experience for all:
