On March 22, 2025, during Women's Military History Week, Maria and I had the honor of representing Wilderness Pathfinder Connections at the "Moving Forward Together! Women Educating and Inspiring Generations" panel at Pacific University. This event, organized in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Veterans' Affairs and Washington County, aimed to highlight the invaluable contributions of women veterans and foster a dialogue on their experiences and challenges. ​[oregondva.com](https://oregondva.com/events/womens-history-month-iani-exhibit-at-odva-466/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

**Sharing Our Stories**

The panel provided a platform for us to share our personal journeys in the military, shedding light on the unique challenges and triumphs faced by women in service. We delved into topics such as leadership, mentorship, and the importance of representation. Our goal was to inspire and educate attendees, emphasizing the critical role women have played—and continue to play—in the armed forces.​

**Community Impact**

The response from the community was deeply moving. Paul Riggs, Program Specialist at Washington County Health and Human Services, conveyed his gratitude, noting the significant impact our stories had on attendees. He shared that multiple veterans and community members expressed how meaningful the discussions were, highlighting the importance of such dialogues in fostering understanding and support.​

**A City Councilor's Reflection**

Forest Grove City Councilor Brian Schimmel attended the event and later reflected on its impact in his newsletter. He candidly shared how the panel prompted him to reconsider his own family's military experiences, acknowledging the often-overlooked narratives of women veterans. His reflections underscore the broader societal need to recognize and honor the diverse stories within our veteran community.​

**Looking Ahead**

Participating in this panel reinforced the mission of our nonprofit: to advocate for and support women veterans. Events like these are pivotal in bringing to light the experiences of women in the military, ensuring their stories are heard, valued, and integrated into the broader narrative of military history.​ We are committed to continuing this vital work, ensuring that the voices of women veterans are heard and their contributions recognized.

As we move forward, we remain committed to creating spaces where women veterans can share their experiences, find support, and inspire future generations. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the organizers, fellow panelists, and attendees who made this event a resounding success.
