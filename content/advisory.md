Sher is a 9 year OIF/OEF Navy Nuclear Electronics Technician with 3 deployments. After leaving the Navy, she became the first female power plant control operator on the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) electrical grid. Sher graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a Bachelor of Science in Retailing with three minors in Textile Science, Business, and Entrepreneurship. In addition to being a wilderness guide with Veteran Rites, she works with homeless youth and fights against food insecurity in her community. Sher wears many hats: first-generation immigrant, first-generation college graduate, wife, mother, dog mom, and part-time caregiver of her mother. Yet, one's own identity has been elusive for her. Sher’s path towards healing and self-discovery has not been easy due to the trauma she has experienced, but her resolution to seek help and guidance brought her to Veteran Rites. She knows the path towards healing can be difficult and daunting, however, she is ready to help cast a shining light for the lost. At Veteran Rites, she hopes to lead by example and guide others with compassion. When Sher is away from Veteran Rites she spends her time as a visual artist, writer, master gardener, Filipino reconstructionist, and petter of dogs.
