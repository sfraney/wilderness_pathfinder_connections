description = "We hold deep admiration and gratitude for the individuals who have guided us, challenged us, and supported us on this path. Their wisdom, mentorship, and encouragement have been invaluable in shaping not only our personal journeys but also the creation of this nonprofit. Without their guidance—mentally, spiritually, and practically—we would not be where we are today. This section honors their contributions and recognizes them as part of the foundation of our work."
