#### Naming the Mentor Network

To align with your nonprofitâ€™s themes, consider names like:

* **Pathfinder Mentors** (straightforward)
* **The Circle of Guides** (symbolic, more community-oriented)
* **The Waymark Network** (a waymark is a trail marker)

Would you prefer something simple or something with more depth?

### Mentor Network Structure

Your idea of a **mentor selection system** sounds well thought out and **doable.**

* A list of mentors with bios
* Mentees approach mentors directly
* When a mentor takes on a mentee, their profile dims and becomes unclickable
* One mentee per mentor (at first)

> Mentors image<br><br>Their experience - whatever they want to share about themselves.
>
> what they are looking for in a mentee - just beginning or seeking deeper learning<br><br>Way to contact them/forward emails to them so their private email isn't available
