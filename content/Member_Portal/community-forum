This is your space to connect, ask questions, and engage in conversations that matter. The Community Forum is where experiences are shared, wisdom is exchanged, and support is given. Join the discussion, explore topics related to our mission, and become part of the collective voice shaping this work.<br><br>Naming the Mentor Network

To align with your nonprofitâ€™s themes, consider names like:

* **Pathfinder Mentors** (straightforward)
* **The Circle of Guides** (symbolic, more community-oriented)
* **The Waymark Network** (a waymark is a trail marker)

Would you prefer something simple or something with more depth?
