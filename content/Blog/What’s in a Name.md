Choosing a name is no small task. It carries meaning, intention, and a vision for what’s to come. When we set out to create this organization, we wanted a name that was **punchy, memorable, and easy to type**—something that wouldn’t make our web domain a hassle to enter. But more importantly, we wanted a name that reflected our mission and the heart of what we do.

That’s where **"Connections"** came in.

Debbee first introduced the idea of incorporating connections into the name, and it immediately struck a chord. Maria resonated with it, too, because, at our core, **that’s what we’re all about**—building **connections** between guides, seekers, mentors, and the larger community.

Our work is about **weaving together relationships, knowledge, and opportunities**—whether it’s supporting future guides, mentoring those stepping into leadership, or strengthening the bonds within our healing traditions. The name captures the essence of what we’re creating: **a network of support, empowerment, and transformation.**

With this name, we march forth into our mission—grounded in purpose and strengthened by the connections we build along the way.
