# Mentor Directory

Welcome to the Mentor Directoryâ€”a network of experienced mentors offering guidance, wisdom, and support. Whether you're just beginning or seeking deeper learning, this directory helps you find the right mentor to walk alongside you on your journey. Each connection is intentional, ensuring that mentorship is meaningful, transformative, and aligned with your path.

## Mentor Network Structure

Your idea of a **mentor selection system** sounds well thought out and **doable.**

* A list of mentors with bios
* Mentees approach mentors directly
* When a mentor takes on a mentee, their profile dims and becomes unclickable
* One mentee per mentor (at first)

> **Mentor Profile Structure:**  
> * Mentor's image and bio - their experience and what they want to share about themselves
> * Mentee preferences - what they are looking for in a mentee (just beginning or seeking deeper learning)
> * Contact method - secure way to reach out without exposing private email addresses
