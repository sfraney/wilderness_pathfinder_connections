# Post-Selection Expectations & Fund Accountability

> Once selected, sponsored guides enter a phase of growth and mentorship. This page outlines the expectations for sponsorship recipients and how we ensure that funds are used appropriately to drive transformative leadership.

**Expectations:**

* **Mentorship Commitment:** Recipients are expected to mentor new guides after completing a minimum of \[X\] ceremonies/training sessions.
* **Progress Reporting:** Provide regular updates on your training progress and share success stories (written reports and photos).
* **Accountability:** Funds are monitored through quarterly reviews, and recipients must adhere to the terms outlined in the sponsorship agreement.

  &nbsp;

> Our goal is to create a lasting impact, ensuring that every dollar invested supports leadership development and community transformation. Thank you for being part of this journey.
