### **Posting Frequency**

* **Starting Weekly (for a month or two):** Helps establish an initial presence and gives you content to reference.
* **Shifting to Monthly:** Keeps people engaged without making it a burden.
* **Occasional Bonus Posts:** If something significant happens, like an event or funding milestone, you can add an extra post.

Once a month is a good long-term goal, but front-loading a few posts can help build momentum.
