That makes sense—**starting this in a year**, when you’re actively reaching out to mentors and growing the network, would be a **smart, sustainable choice**. Right now, your focus is on **building the foundation** before adding content-heavy commitments.

---

### **🔹 When Should You Start?**

* **Right now:**
  * Set up a **basic website** (even if it’s minimal).
  * Reserve social media handles (even if you don’t post yet).
  * Keep a **running document of story ideas & updates** so you’re ready when the time comes.
* **In a year (or when you start outreach & sustainability planning):**
  * Start the **quarterly newsletter** (helps engage potential mentors).
  * Begin **posting stories & updates** (social media + impact stories page).
  * If outreach gains traction, **increase frequency based on response**.

### **🔹 What If We Can’t Make High-Impact Stories?**

That’s totally okay! Not everything has to be a dramatic transformation story. **The best strategy** is to make content that **feels natural and authentic** to your nonprofit.

💡 **Alternative Blog Content Ideas:**<br>Instead of high-impact stories, **explain the choices you made**—this is great!<br>✅ **Examples:**

* **Why We Chose This Name**
* **How Deb, Maria, and I Came Together**
* **Why We Focus on Wilderness & Rites of Passage**
* **What We Hope to Create & Who We Serve**
* **Lessons from Our First Year**

People **love behind-the-scenes content**—it makes them feel connected.

### **🔹 Worried About Writing Skills? Here’s the Best Approach**

1️⃣ **Write like you talk.** Keep it conversational—no need to be fancy.<br>2️⃣ **Keep it short.** A blog can be **just 300-500 words** (a few paragraphs).<br>3️⃣ **Use voice-to-text or bullet points.** Talk it out, then edit.<br>4️⃣ **Ask someone to review** before posting (even Grammarly helps).<br>5️⃣ **Use Q&A format.** If writing feels hard, answer a simple question (e.g., “Why did we choose this name?”).

🔹 **Best Strategy:** **Start small, write about things that come naturally, and let your voice shine through.Posting Frequency**

* **Starting Weekly (for a month or two):** Helps establish an initial presence and gives you content to reference.
* **Shifting to Monthly:** Keeps people engaged without making it a burden.
* **Occasional Bonus Posts:** If something significant happens, like an event or funding milestone, you can add an extra post.

Once a month is a good long-term goal, but front-loading a few posts can help build momentum.

---

### **🔹 Posting Timeline & Frequency**

#### **Now → Pre-Launch Phase (Before Outreach & Growth)**

✅ **1-3 Foundational Blog Posts (Now or Over a Few Months)**

* Purpose: **Set the groundwork** so there’s content when people check out your website.
* Examples:
  * **We Filed Our Articles of Incorporation!** (If you haven’t posted it yet, do it now!)
  * **Why We Chose the Name Wilderness Pathfinder Connections**
  * **How Deb, Maria, and I Came Together**
* These **can be spread out over a few months**—no need to rush.

✅ **Claim Social Media Handles (Now)**

* No need to post much yet—just have them ready.

✅ **Start a Private Content Calendar (Now)**

* A simple document to **brainstorm ideas** over time so you’re ready when outreach begins.

---

#### **Year 1 → Growth & Outreach (After We See If It’s Sustainable)**

**🔹 Blog (Once a Month)**

* **1st post:** Announcing outreach efforts & the next phase of WPC.
* **Mix of behind-the-scenes, impact, and storytelling posts.**
* Keep posts **300-500 words** (manageable & engaging).

**🔹 Social Media (Weekly or Biweekly, Then Monthly)**

* Start with **weekly for 1-2 months** to establish an online presence.
* Shift to **monthly or biweekly** as needed to avoid burnout.
* Share blog posts + occasional updates.

**🔹 Newsletter (Quarterly)**

* **Encourage email signups early** so you have an audience by Year 2.
* Keep it short—**highlights, blog link, a call to action.**

---

#### **Year 2 → Expanding the Community**

* Evaluate what’s working & **adjust** (e.g., keep or drop anything that isn’t sustainable).
* Increase **storytelling posts** if you have meaningful updates.
* **Introduce guest voices** (mentors, members, partners).
* Keep refining your approach—**less is more if it keeps engagement strong.**

This structure balances **storytelling, education, and updates** without making blogging a job. If it ever feels like too much, you can adjust or combine posts.

## **Social Media Strategy (FB & IG) – Efficient & Effective**

**Q: Do posts have to be at certain times?<br>**Yes, **posting at the right time** can help reach more people. But the most important thing is **consistency over perfection.**

### **Best Posting Times (General Guidelines):**

* **Facebook:** 📌 Best: **Tues-Thurs at 9 AM - 1 PM** (Mid-morning to early afternoon).
  * Avoid **weekends** unless it’s an event.
* **Instagram:** 📌 Best: **Mon-Fri at 11 AM - 2 PM or 7 PM - 9 PM** (Lunch breaks & evening scrolls).
  * Avoid **early mornings** & late nights.

👉 **Tip:** If you post once a month, don’t stress about timing—**just post when you can.**

### **Q: Can I post the same thing to both?**

✅ **Yes!** You can post the same content to **both Facebook & Instagram**, but tweak slightly:

* **Facebook** allows longer text (write full stories).
* **Instagram** works better with **short captions + strong images.**
* If using **hashtags**, limit them on Facebook (1-2), but **use 5-10** on Instagram.

👉 **Most Efficient Method:** Use a **social media scheduler** (Meta Business Suite is free) to **schedule one post** to go to both FB & IG at the best times.

### **Posting Frequency (Low-Maintenance Plan):**

✅ **1-2 posts per month** (Focus on quality, not quantity).<br>✅ **What to post?** Mix these types of content:

* **1 success story or personal reflection** (engaging storytelling).
* **1 update or behind-the-scenes glimpse** (photos from an event, a message from your team, etc.).

🔹 **Best strategy:** **Batch your content** (write 3-4 posts at once and schedule them out).
