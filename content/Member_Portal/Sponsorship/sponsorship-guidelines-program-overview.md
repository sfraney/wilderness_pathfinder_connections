Establishing a transparent and fair sponsorship program is crucial for Wilderness Pathfinder Connections. Below are detailed guidelines to assist in this process:

**1\. Selection Committee Participation:**

* **Involvement of Founders:** As founders, you, Debbee, and Maria can serve on the selection committee. However, it's essential to manage potential conflicts of interest. If an applicant has a personal or professional relationship with any committee member, that member should disclose the relationship and recuse themselves from discussions and decisions regarding that applicant.
* **Disclosure Practices:** Implement a conflict of interest policy requiring all committee members to disclose any relationships with applicants. This ensures decisions are made impartially and maintain the organization's integrity.

**2\. Transparency of Committee Members:**

* **Public Listing:** While it's not mandatory to publicly list selection committee members, doing so can enhance transparency and trust in your process. If you choose to list members, consider including brief biographies to highlight their qualifications and commitment to the organization's mission.

**3\. Sponsorship Program Webpage Content:**

Creating a comprehensive yet concise webpage will inform potential applicants about the sponsorship program. Here's a suggested structure:

* **Progress Reporting:** Recipients should provide updates on their training and guiding experiences, including written reports and photographs, to demonstrate the impact of the sponsorship and for potential feature on our blog.

**Ensuring Proper Use of Funds:**

* **Agreements:** Selected applicants will sign an agreement detailing the sponsorship terms, including fund allocation, mentorship obligations, and reporting requirements.
* **Monitoring:** Regular check-ins will be conducted to ensure funds are utilized appropriately, aligning with the program's objectives.

**4\. Application Form Components:**

The application form should collect the following information:

* **Personal Information:** Full name, contact details, and background.

This approach keeps the main page concise, with links to more detailed information as needed.

**6\. Mentorship Timing:**

Requiring sponsored individuals to mentor others after completing a certain number of ceremonies ensures they have adequate experience to provide valuable guidance. This approach fosters a supportive community and maintains high standards within your guide network.

**7\. Documentation and Content Sharing:**

Encouraging recipients to document their experiences with reports and photos serves multiple purposes:

* **Accountability:** Ensures funds are used as intended.
* **Engagement:** Provides authentic content for your blog, showcasing the program's impact and inspiring others.

**8\. Additional Considerations:**

* **Conflict of Interest Policy:** Develop a policy outlining how potential conflicts are managed, including disclosure requirements and recusal procedures.
* **Committee Member Listing:** Decide whether to publicly list committee members based on your organization's transparency goals and privacy considerations.

By implementing these guidelines, Wilderness Pathfinder Connections can establish a robust sponsorship program that empowers future guides while maintaining transparency and accountability.
