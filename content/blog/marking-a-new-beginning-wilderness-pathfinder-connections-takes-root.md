Today, we celebrate a milestone—the official formation of Wilderness Pathfinder Connections! What began as a vision has now taken root, and we couldn’t be more excited to embark on this journey with you.

Our mission is simple yet profound: to **fund, equip, and support** women veterans as they step into their roles as Rite of Passage Wilderness Guides. By removing barriers and fostering connection, we ensure that **nature-based healing and leadership** remain accessible to those who seek them.

This isn’t just the start of an organization—it’s the continuation of a movement. A movement of women veterans stepping into their power, of traditions being honored, and of community and mentorship lighting the way for those who come next.

We are deeply grateful for every conversation, every shared experience, and every person who has helped bring this vision to life. **Thank you for being part of it.**

In the months ahead, we’ll share more about our journey, the work ahead, and ways to get involved. But today, we celebrate. **Here’s to the path ahead!**

With gratitude,<br>

**The Wilderness Pathfinder Connections Team**
