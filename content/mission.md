## The Story Behind Our Nonprofit

For years, we dedicated ourselves to organizations that support veterans, believing in the power of ceremony, healing, and community. However, time and time again, we encountered barriers—roadblocks that limited access, created unnecessary hurdles for those seeking guidance, and upheld systemic issues that have historically kept women and people of color from leadership roles. The lack of resources and funding made these challenges even more difficult to overcome, and too often, passionate individuals eager to contribute were left unsupported.

We saw a pattern: passionate individuals, eager to learn and contribute, were often met with resistance instead of support. Promises of mentorship rarely materialized, funding for initiatives felt out of reach, and transparency was lacking. Women and people of color, in particular, were frequently asked to give their labor for free—an all-too-common experience across many spaces.

It became clear that if we wanted real change, we had to create it ourselves. With the encouragement of trusted allies, we stepped forward to build something new. A space where women veterans are truly supported in their journey—not just in words, but in action.

Our nonprofit is rooted in accessibility, equity, and the belief that those who seek healing and leadership should not have to navigate endless obstacles to do so. We are here to ensure that mentorship is real, that resources are available, and that no one is left feeling like an afterthought. We honor the land, the wisdom of those who came before us, and the future we are building together.

This isn’t just about breaking barriers; it’s about creating a community where women veterans can grow, lead, and thrive—without limitations.

## Our Mission

Wilderness Pathfinder Connections is a nonprofit dedicated to empowering women veterans to become Rite of Passage Wilderness Guides, expanding access to nature-based healing, self-generated ceremony, and a deep connection to the land. We provide funding, education, and resources to remove systemic barriers and ensure that diverse voices, experiences, and traditions are honored. By cultivating a supportive web of guides and guides-in-training, we foster the creation of pathways for personal transformation, cultural renewal, and collective healing.

## Our Vision

Wilderness Pathfinder Connections envisions a world where women veterans are recognized as leaders in nature-based healing and self-generated ceremony. Through education, resources, and a strong web of guides and guides-in-training, we cultivate long-term change to cultivate cultural and community renewal. We ensure that diverse traditions are honored, knowledge is shared with integrity, and future generations have access to these transformative practices. By fostering personal growth, collective healing, and new pathways of renewal, we create lasting change for individuals and communities alike.
