[[Supporting those who seek, guiding those who lead (1) 1.png]]
We’re thrilled to share some exciting news—Wilderness Pathfinder Connections is now officially recognized by the IRS as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization!

This moment marks a major milestone in our journey. What began as a seed of an idea between veterans seeking healing and connection has now grown into a recognized nonprofit committed to uplifting women veterans through nature-based leadership and community-building.

This new status means:

- Your donations to Wilderness Pathfinder Connections are now tax-deductible.
    
- We’re eligible for more grant opportunities that support our mission.
    
- We can deepen our impact and expand our reach to serve even more women veterans.
    

But more than anything, this is a celebration of community. This recognition affirms that our vision—to create space for women veterans to heal, lead, and thrive—is not only necessary, but supported.

We’re incredibly grateful to everyone who believed in this dream from the beginning. Your encouragement, wisdom, and love helped us build the foundation we’re standing on now.

We have a long path ahead—but now, we walk it together.
