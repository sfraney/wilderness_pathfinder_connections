Names carry power. They shape identity, convey purpose, and reflect values. When we set out to name our organization, we knew we wanted something **punchy, memorable, and easy to type**—but more than that, it needed to embody who we are and what we stand for.

### **Finding the Right Path**

Early on, we explored different names that reflected **growth, transformation, and connection to the land**. "Roots and Renewal" had a nice ring to it, with the repetition of sounds giving it a rhythmic quality. But as much as we loved the feeling it evoked, it didn’t quite fit the vision we had for the organization.

That led us to explore other possibilities, and the word **Wayfinder** emerged. It resonated deeply—after all, we were on a journey, finding our way to becoming Wilderness guides and stepping into our power. It felt like a perfect match. But before we committed, we needed to understand where the term came from and whether it was truly ours to use.

### **Honoring Culture and Integrity**

In researching "Wayfinder," we learned that while the concept of wayfinding exists across many cultures, the specific term is strongly associated with **Polynesian navigation traditions**. As a Filipina, I initially wondered if it could apply more broadly to all Austronesian peoples, given our shared seafaring heritage. But the more I dug, the clearer it became that this word carries deep significance within **Polynesian** cultures.

At the same time, I noticed that a marketing company—headed by a young white man—had also adopted the name. Seeing that, I had to ask myself: **If I felt uncomfortable with him using it, why should I feel comfortable using it myself?** It was a moment of reflection on **cultural respect, appreciation vs. appropriation, and what it means to honor traditions that are not fully ours to claim.**

So, we decided to let go of "Wayfinder" and return to the drawing board.

### **A Name That Reflects Our Purpose**

That’s when we started playing with variations. "Wilderness Pathfinder" felt close, but a for-profit company already had that domain, and we didn’t want to be confused with them. Then Debbee and Maria brought in their own insights—Debbee suggesting **"Connections,"** and Maria loving how it reflected what we are truly about: **bringing people together, sharing knowledge, and honoring the land and the traditions we walk alongside.**

In the end, our name is more than just words—it is a commitment. A commitment to **honoring different cultures and ways of life, to practicing deep respect for the lands we walk on, and to building a community rooted in integrity and purpose.**

We’re proud of the name we chose and the values it represents. And as we continue this journey, we hope to inspire others to walk with the same thoughtfulness and respect.
