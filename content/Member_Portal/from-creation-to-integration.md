title = "From Creation to Integration (Nonprofit & Ceremony Resources)"
description = "A journey of building, leading, and integrating is a path of deep responsibility, service, and transformation. We are at the beginning of this journey ourselves, navigating the challenges, lessons, and growth that come with it. In this section, we share our experiences, reflections, and insights—not as experts, but as fellow travelers—so that others may learn from our process. While we may not yet run ceremonies ourselves, we have gathered wisdom on many aspects of the journey, from forming an organization to holding space and supporting integration. Whether you are envisioning a new community, stepping into leadership, or ensuring long-term impact, these resources offer guidance, tools, and the lived experiences of those walking this path."
